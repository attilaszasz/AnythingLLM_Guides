To use Gemini models from Google, you’ll need an API key. If you don’t already have one, create a key in Google AI Studio.

Get an API key here: [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)

Copy your key.

Choose **Gemini** in the LLM Preference screen.

Paste the previously created key into the **Google AI API Key** field.  
Select the `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` model. At the time of writing this guide, this is the best one available on Google for free. The `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` is more advanced, but the usage quota is significantly lower. If there is a newer version, you can try that one instead.

For safety setting, select `None`. This will allow the model to generate any type of content.

Click on the right arrow to proceed to the next step.

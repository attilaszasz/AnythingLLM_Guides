Select an LLM model you'd like to use. If you have a GPU in your computer, a good rule of thumb is to select a model that's size is roughly two thirds of your GPU's VRAM.  
For example, if you have a 12GB GPU, you can select a model that's around 8GB in size.  

If you don't have a GPU, you can still use a model, but you should select a smaller one. **Gemma 2B** or **Phi-3** are good choices for CPU only systems.

Click on the chosen model and then click on **Save changes**.  
Wait for the model to download. You can see the progress in the upper right corner of the app.

When finished, click on the **Back to workspaces** icon.
